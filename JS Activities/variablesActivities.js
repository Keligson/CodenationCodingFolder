//--------- ACTIVITY 1 ---------
// Console.log each variable
// Update each variable


// let studentFirstName="Adam"
// let studentAge="27"
// let courseStudent=true

// console.log(studentFirstName)
// console.log(studentAge)
// console.log(courseStudent)

// studentFirstName="Bear"
// studentAge="5"
// courseStudent=false

// console.log(studentFirstName)
// console.log(studentAge)
// console.log(courseStudent)





//--------- ACTIVITY 2 ---------
// Write code that stores your name, age, and favourite colour
// The stored data must be output to the console in a complete sentence


// let myName="Adam"
// let age="27"
// let favColour="Green"
// console.log(`Hi, my name is ${name}. I'm a ${age} and my favorite colour is ${favColour}.`)





//--------- ACTIVITY 3 ---------
// Write code which stores what you may eat today for breakfast, lunch and dinner
// This must also be output to the console in a complete sentence
// Update the stored data and output the same sentence again to display the changes


// let breakfastMeal="protien bar"
// let lunchMeal="cereal"
// let dinnerMeal="sweet & sour prawns with egg noodles"
// console.log(`Today for breakfast I had a ${breakfastMeal}. For lunch I had ${lunchMeal}, and my for dinner I will have ${dinnerMeal}.`)

// breakfastMeal="salad"
// lunchMeal="scrambled eggs"
// dinnerMeal="turkey meatballs with rice"
// console.log(`Today for breakfast I had a ${breakfastMeal}. For lunch I had ${lunchMeal}, and my for dinner I will have ${dinnerMeal}.`)





//--------- ACTIVITY 4 ---------
// Write code which will calculate how many days from todayâ€™s date to your birthday
// This must also be output to the console in a complete sentence
// Why not stretch. Calculate how many days since your birth?


// let nextBirthday = new Date ("2023-02-15")
// let birthday = new Date ("1995-02-15")
// let today  = new Date()
// let until = nextBirthday.getTime() - today.getTime()
// let from = today.getTime() - birthday.getTime()
// let alive = Math.floor(from / (1000*60*60*24))
// let days = Math.floor(until / (1000*60*60*24))

// console.log(nextBirthday)
// console.log(today)
// console.log(until)
// console.log(days)

// console.log(`Today's date: ${today}. My birthday: ${nextBirthday}. It's ${days} until my birthday! I've been on earth for ${alive} days`)
